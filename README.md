# CS489_ResearchingParallelCollisions
Combination of Computational Geometry and Physics to solve a Narrow Phase Time of Intersection Inquiry

This was research for an independent project in CS498 at Colorado State University.

This work only demonstrates the simplest collision test to perform. Additional work is left to be explored.

Additionally, this work demonstrates how to use the Thread Pool class that has been simultaneously published.
